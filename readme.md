This is a gridded map editor primary for creating Chinese TRPG tactical maps for use in IRC.

It is rather outdated now, and **only basic maintenance will be done**.

Some context to better understand the 'outdated' part:

* This project was started in 2009, when I first learned JavaScript.
People were using IE 8 and Firefox 3.5.  *Chrome wasn't born yet.*

* Chinese, because Chinese characters are expressive and equal width.
And Unicode were not as expressive or widely supported as they are now (think Windows XP).

* jQuery UI was in a pretty early stage, and this was my first major JS app.
